# `show-when`

A Web Component
for showing or hiding content
when given conditions are met.

**[Demo](https://oddbird.github.io/show-when/demo.html)**

## Examples

General usage example:

```html
<script type="module" src="show-when.js"></script>

<show-when has-param="edit">
  This will be visible by default,
  but will hide
  if the current url
  does not have
  the `edit` query parameter attached.
</show-when>

<show-when has-support="container-name: any" hidden>
  This will be hidden by default,
  but show up in browsers
  that support container queries.
</show-when>
```

Example using `has-any` option:

```html
<script type="module" src="show-when.js"></script>

<show-when has-hash="slide-2" has-param="show_all" has-any>
  This will be visible
  if either the hash or query parameter
  is present in the URL
</show-when>
```

## ToDo

- Add support for container queries
